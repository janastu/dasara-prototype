        <h2>Tradition & History</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p> 
        Dasara is derived from Sanskrit, and literally means 10("Dasa") days("ahar"). So, this is a celebration of 10 days, and the 10th day is Dasara.

        Other names prevailent for the festival are Dussehra(in northern India), Durga Pooja (in Eastern India), Durgotsava, navaratri, and so on..</p>
        <p>It seems that during its early inception Dasara was an all night event with offerings to Godessess and other poojas. Hence this festival was also called as nine("nava") nights("ratri"). As time passed, and people evolved into urban lifestyles, the late night offerings and pooja became a day event which can still be seen followed similarly.</p>
        <p>Dasara is celebrated in two parts, the first nine days is one part of the festivity, and the 10th day or the day of Victory, is the second and the last part of the celebrations.



        The days of celebration is chosen through the Lunar calendar, Month of Ashwayuja(gregorian months of Sep-Oct, from 2nd day of waxing moon till the 10th day.

        This entire 10 day festivity is commonly called Dasara, than just indicating the 10th day of celebrations.</p>

        <p>All over India, the feminine Godess Durga and her other forms of incarnation like Lakshmi(Godess for economy), Saraswathi (Godess for Wisdom), and so on..</p>

        <p>This tradition of female diety worship is followed since Vedic times, Rig Veda suggest that the Hindu's belief in the Feminine diety was in favour of considering hers as the all prevading energy of the universe, and all life and Gods as we perceive have come out of this Mother, The Mother of All known and knowing.</p>

        <p>We can see the mentioning of Dasara and diety worshipping since the times of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Apart from that historians have found that Devagiri's Yadavas, Hoysalas, Warangal's Kakateeyas celebrated Navaratri in accordance to the afore mentioned Vedic traditions.</p>

        <p>A Bronze statue of Mother Durga in form of Mahisasura-mardini (lit. The Killer of Buffalo headed Demon) was found from Shimoga District in Karnataka and is believed to be from 5th Century. Looking at all this historic evidence and other cultural texts, we can put forth this argument that Female diety worshipping has been a long lived Tradition as part of Indian Culture, and a rough estimate that these celebrations have survived time scales of about 2000 years.</p>


        <p>The Tradition and History of Royal Dasara can be traced back to the Vijayanagara Empire[1336 A.D-1646 A.D]. keen on protecting the Hindu religion and culture from destruction by Muslim invaders, laid great emphasis on the restoration of temples and religious festivals during their reign. During the period of Proudaraya and Deva Raya or Krishna Deva Raya of the Vijayanagara empire, The Navaratri festival started receiving royal patronage, and it acquired the status of a state festival. It was celebrated with great pomp, enthusiasm and fervor, and attracted visitors from many part of the country and even abroad. Political, administrative, religious and social significance with the appreciation of the laity added to its grandeur.</p>

        <p>The Mysore Kingdom was a small feudatory Kingdom under the Vijayanagara Empire. With the fall of Vijayanagara Empire, The Mysore kings, the Wodeyars inherited and perpetuated the traditions of Vijayanagara Empire thus showing their goodwill to the fallen Empire and it's great Men.

        <h2>Hampi Royal Dasara</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p> 
        The Most significant history of Dasara is it's relation to the Vijayanagara Dynasty. The historians have detailed about the Vijayadashami tradition in this region, and we can see that though empires have fallen, but the rituals and traditions haven't died. These human ideas are exquisite human expressions, which has spread across the society, lived, propogated like a living organism, and still evolving in the modern day society.</p>



        <p>Dasara was celeberated with great religious importance, devout and passion since the Vijayanagara times. Hampi's Mahanavami Dibba and Hazara Rama Temple is the living witness of a glorious past.</p>



        <p>All along the side walls of the Mahanavami Dibba, we can find sculptures of Wrestlers (Garadi or kushti), Hunters, Horse traders, Camel traders, Gymnasts, other Street acts, jugglers, conjurors and illusionists, Dancers, Instrumentalists, singers, Kings, Door attendants, army chieftains, are speaking of the time begone, and great majesty of the Dasara celebrations.</P>



        <p>Hazara Rama being the most important diety of the Royal family of Vijayanagara, we can see that the Temple was built attached close to the palace complex. This temple also has beautifully designed sculptures of Bhagawata, Mahabharata and Ramayana stories.



        The outer walls of the temple, meaning The walls to East, Nort and West, have sculptures of Elephant rows, Horse rows, Camel rows, Army Knight team, Army Bishop team, Army Rooke team, swords and other short range weapons team, and long range weapons team like the bows and arrows and other depictions of the then defence system.

        Apart from that Folk artists like, kolata, dombaraata, wrestlers & gymnasts, okali aata, instrumental artists playing shenai and other musical instruments, Bharatanatya dancers, street dancers, monkey charmers and various other artists and performers from different parts of the kingdom and around.

        This shows that, All the artists, the Royal defence and other people involving all hierarchies of the then living society was religiously involved with the celbrations and processions is documented by Foreign travellers travelogues around the world.</p>

        <p>Bharatesha Vaibhava, a great piece of Literature from RatnakaraVarni cites the Dasara celebration from the 14th-15th century A.D in it's Chapter Mahanavami Sandhu.</p>

        <p>If all this is the preserved historic evidence of a bygone time, another side of the story is the survival of these traditions amongst the local culture and society for whom still Mahanavami is the most important annual festival.</p>



        <p>Mahanavami, Dasara, Navaratri, Banni Habba, Hiriyara Habba are the synonyms for Dasara in Hampi region where this tradition is found to be followed even before the vijayanagra Kings.

        Foreign travellers who visited this region during the Vijayangara period have published their travelogues add to this available evidences and most important of them will be Abdur Razzak, Domingo Paes and Nuniz ...



        Nuniz's description of Common folk's dasara..

        Their writings made references to the ‘great feast’ celebrated for nine days in what is inferred to be Dasara; the wrestling competitions, the musicians and dancers entertaining the court, the march of the caparisoned elephants, decorated horses, foot soldiers and the tableaux.

        <h2>Mysooru Royal Dasara</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>The Divine Mother Durga would be worshiped on all these nine days of Navaratri in her different forms as believed in the Hindu tradition.

        On the first day, the King, after having a ceremonial bath, would perform purificatory rites. He would then worship his family deity, Goddess Chamundi, and would wear the ceremonial, sacred wrist - band which signified his intention to perform the sacred rituals with devotion and dedication. He would then enter the durbar with the accompaniment of sacred chants and music. The tradition of the durbar, an adoption from the Mugal emperors, was first introduced by Mummadi[lit. The Third] Krishnaraja Wadiyar, and it is an assembly of the royal court, attended by the invitees, chief citizens, members of the royal family, palace officials, royal priests, and the intelligentsia.



        He would also worship the throne as per the ancient injunctions. He would then circumambulate the throne thrice and ascend it at an auspicious moment. Later royal insignia and sword were presented to him amid prayers to the Goddess. At that moment all the lights in the palace would come alive, and there would be the royal 21- gun salute.</p>



        <p>After this the king would sit on the throne and receive royal guests. Soon after this, the royal elephant and horse would receive ablutions and worship. The court would present the king with the offerings received from various temples and religious centers (mathas). This was followed by Vedic chants, sprinkling of holy waters and blessings by the royal priests. The vassal kings[or feudatory], dewans, army chiefs and other royal staff would come and offer their respects to the throne in earlier times. Musical instruments would start an ensemble accompanied by dance performance, and the blowing of conch es and trumpets with the parade of uniformed soldiers and other staff.</p>



        <p>The beautifully decorated royal elephant would arrive showering roses on the assembled guests; and the royal horse, equally well - decorated, would bend down on its knees in salutation to the throne. The assembly would leave the court after bowing down to the king once again and the queen, accompanied by the other royal ladies, would come to pay obeisance to the king who would share the offerings received from the temples with them. The queen mother and the other senior ladies would bless him good health. The king would then leave the durbar hall and partake of the noon meal with the royal guests, after praying to the Goddess once again.</p>



        <p>The same procedure would be followed on all the Navaratri evenings with the addition of acrobatic feats, wrestling bouts by champions, fireworks display and other entertainment’s, watched by the teeming masses everyday. While the durbar would be held in the outer court the worship would be done within the palace. The king would worship Goddess Sarasvati on the seventh day and Mahisasuramardini on the eighth. On the mahanavami day, the royal sword would be worshiped ceremoniously, signifying the worship of all the weapons and would be taken out in procession accompanied by the army, elephants, horses, camels and the royal retinue.

        The assembly rooms of the palace and the royal insignia would also be worshiped.</p>

        <h2> Banni Pooje </h2>
        <h3></h3>

        <p>After a mile - long walk, the procession would reach the Bannimantap site, where the king, after a bath, would worship the sami (orbanni in Kannada) tree. Worshiping this tree before embarking on any war adventure was customary for kings of this dynasty. The Wadiyar king would return to his palace after viewing the wonderful torchlight parade and the grand fireworks display at Bannimantap. That would conclude the Vijayadasami festivities.</p>

 <h2> Jambu Savari </h2>
        <p>The Navaratri celebrations would reach their culmination with the grandest Vijayadasami celebrations, also called in popular parlance as Jambu Savari. The grandeur and magnificence of this event has popularized the Navaratri celebrations of Mysore both in India and abroad. On this day, after ablutions, the king would worship the royal sword again and place it in a palanquin, would offer an ash gourd smeared with vermilion as sacrifice to it. He would follow the grand procession, seated on the historically famous golden howdah bedecked with the rarest gems and pearls, which was carried by the royal elephant.



        The next day, after the Goddess Camundesvari would be worshiped with great devotion, the king would honor distinguished personalities by conferring titles on them. That would mark the close of the grand ten - day - long celebrations during the days of the kings.









        The beginning of the traditional Vijayadasami procession, which is continued even today with the same - if not more - fervor and devotion, would be announced with a 21- round gun salute. The important streets of Mysore city would be decorated beautifully with electric bulbs. Millions of people from everywhere would stand on both sides of the route - as they do today also - to witness the grand procession.</p>
